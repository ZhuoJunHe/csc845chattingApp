# csc845 project Mini Chatting App

Members: Zhuojun He,  Swetha Govindu

# The Goal
To create a chatting app is the goal of our project. We will use python to create client and server programs for text messaging and the function of Internet chatting.

This app will contain a server and a client program. The server side holds all the account, password and the other necessary data information. It also handles different requests from the client side. The client side is for different users to connect to the server. This app will have two functions: text messaging between two clients asynchronously and instant chatting between two clients synchronously.   



# Preliminary Results
We have built a client and a server app where the client can send a short message to the server and the server will echos it back. Also, by using multi-threading, a second client can also join the server and communicate with the server. 


# Remaining Tasks
1.Create the login function in the server
2.Message chatting between the clients
3.Encryption and Decryption between the communication if time allows
